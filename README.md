# Multi-Digit-number-recognition-in-natural-images

## Acheived a test accuracy of 91%
## Run test.py to check accuray
## Test.ipynb is nice visualization of the model accuracy
## The trained weights are in the file "phase_4.hdf5"

### Used batch-normalization and dropout
### Used max-norm constraint on weights instead of L2 regularization
### He-normal initialization
### 5 classifiers for 5 digits
### Absence of a digit is realized by using digit "11"
